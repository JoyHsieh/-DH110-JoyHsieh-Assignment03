# Assignment 03: User Research (Contextual Inquiry) - Joy Hsieh, DH110
## Project Description

### Step 01: Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
> The activity is storytelling. This project will help senior citizens share their life stories.
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
> The basic need is esteem. This project may fulfill senior's "lower" esteem needs for "status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention" by allowing them to share their proudest moments and life lessons. It may also boost their "higher" esteem needs for "self-respect, strength, competence, mastery, self-confidence, independence, and freedom" by giving them a sense of accomplishment after successfully sharing.

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> This need can currently be satisfied by forming social connections, allowing seniors to share stories orally, combatting ageist stereotypes, and asking seniors for advice.

### Step 02: Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users?
> * senior citizens (aged 70+)
> * familiar, but not savvy, with technology
> * must be able to speak or write
#### Where would the users do that activity?
> In their home or a care facility.
#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
> Traditionally, they would find a person to tell their story to or they would use a word processing application like Word or Google Docs. They could also use a website like [The Life Writer](https://www.thelifewriter.com).

### Step 03: Research Methods
I used a **direct interview** and **participatory observation** methods. For the interview, I asked about my participant's tech use and motivation to share his story. For the participatory observation, I walked him through [The Life Writer](https://www.thelifewriter.com) to gauge his tech fluency and see how the website could be made better for him.
