# Assignment 03: User Research (Contextual Inquiry) - Joy Hsieh, DH110
## Project Description

### Step 01: Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
> The activity is storytelling. This project will help senior citizens share their life stories.
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
> The basic need is esteem. This project may fulfill senior's "lower" esteem needs for "status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention" by allowing them to share their proudest moments and life lessons. It may also boost their "higher" esteem needs for "self-respect, strength, competence, mastery, self-confidence, independence, and freedom" by giving them a sense of accomplishment after successfully sharing.

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> This need can currently be satisfied by forming social connections, allowing seniors to share stories orally, combatting ageist stereotypes, and asking seniors for advice.

### Step 02: Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users?
> * senior citizens (aged 70+)
> * familiar, but not savvy, with technology
> * must be able to speak or write
#### Where would the users do that activity?
> In their home or a care facility.
#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
> Traditionally, they would find a person to tell their story to or they would use a word processing application like Word or Google Docs. They could also use a website like [The Life Writer](https://www.thelifewriter.com).

### Step 03: Research Methods
I used a **direct interview** and **participatory observation** methods. For the interview, I asked about my participant's tech use and motivation to share his story. For the participatory observation, I walked him through [The Life Writer](https://www.thelifewriter.com) to gauge his tech fluency and see how the website could be made better for him.

### Overall, my goals for this assignment are to:
1. Gauge my participant's desire for storytelling.
2. Assess my participant's fluency and comfort with technology.

## Reflection
Overall, this activity was really helpful and fulfilled the two goals I set: 
1. Gauge my participant's desire for storytelling.
> My participant expressed a desire to share his story if he has a willing audience. He named his wife, daughter, and granddaughter as people who would potentially be interested in hearing his experiences, things he's done, things he's done wrong, and things that make him happy (2:46).
2. Assess my participant's fluency and comfort with technology.
> He is familiar with technology, as he spends about five hours per week on his laptop and 2 hours a day on his phone to check messages from his friends, pay bills, and research things (0:39 - 1:18). However, he seemed to need a lot of help navigating the website. Though he said the website was pretty easy to use and not overwhelming (26:14 - 26:34), he needed help making an account and figuring out what to click on at times.

This assignment confirmed the usefulness of my project, and I am excited to develop my final product. It also opened my eyes to the needs of my users. I didn't expect my participant to watch the video on the main page of the website, but the video introduction and tutorial really helped him understand what the website was all about. As the experimenter, I think I may have been too involved and jumped in to help him at too many times. Ultimately, to create a good experience with my final project, I want to focus on creating a simple, aesthetic UI and make sure to really adhere to the "recognition over recall" heuristic.
